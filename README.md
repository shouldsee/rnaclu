## Redirection

The two following components have been split since August 8th 2018 for modularity.

-  See [rnaclu](https://github.com/shouldsee/rnaclu) for python2 package that clusters trancript abundance matrix,

-  See [synotil](https://github.com/shouldsee/synotil), for command-line pipelines that process raw NGS `.fastq`, 

## Updates:

- August 08th: The Package has been renamed from "synotil" to "rnaclu".
